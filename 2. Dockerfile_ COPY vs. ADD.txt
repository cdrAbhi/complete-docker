### Dockerfile: COPY vs. ADD Instructions

#### COPY
- **Purpose**: Copies files or directories from the host to the container's filesystem files exactly as they are without any decompression..
- **Syntax**: `COPY <source> <destination>`
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  COPY testproject /tmp/project
  ```
  - This command copies the `testproject` directory from the host to `/tmp/project` in the container.

#### ADD
- **Purpose**: Similar to COPY but with additional capabilities.
      => If the source is a compressed file (like `.tar.gz`), it will automatically extract it at the destination.
      => Can also fetch files from URLs, which COPY does not support.

- **Syntax**: `ADD <source> <destination>`
- **Example**:
  ```dockerfile
  ADD testproject.tar.gz /tmp/project
  ```
  - This command copies and extracts `testproject.tar.gz` into `/tmp/project`.

#### Best Practice
- Prefer `COPY` for clarity and specificity, reserving `ADD` for when decompression or URL-fetching is required.
