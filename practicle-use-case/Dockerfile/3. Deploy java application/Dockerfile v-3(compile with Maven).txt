# Build the application
# Running mvn clean package: When the command RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests is executed, Maven reads the pom.xml, resolves all dependencies (including transitive dependencies), downloads them, compiles the code, runs tests (unless skipped), and packages the application into a JAR file located in the target directory.
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests
