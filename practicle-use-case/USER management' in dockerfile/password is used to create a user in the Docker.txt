RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret \
    PASS=$(cat /run/secrets/mysecret) && \
    useradd -d /home/$NAME -g root -G sudo -m -p $(echo "$PASS" | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) $NAME

here you ar using encript password for use using openssl so password must be store somewhere to verify user when user access so My question is where the password available inside the container ?

=================================
GPT ANS : 
================================
In the command you provided, the password is used to create a user in the Docker container and is processed as follows:

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=mysecret \
    PASS=$(cat /run/secrets/mysecret) && \
    useradd -d /home/$NAME -g root -G sudo -m -p $(echo "$PASS" | openssl passwd -1 -stdin) $NAME
```

### Explanation of the Command:
1. **Mounting the Secret**:
   - The `--mount=type=secret,id=mysecret` part mounts the secret identified by `id=mysecret` into the build process. The actual secret (in this case, presumably a password) is made available at `/run/secrets/mysecret`.

2. **Reading the Secret**:
   - `PASS=$(cat /run/secrets/mysecret)` reads the secret (password) from the file and assigns it to the environment variable `PASS`.

3. **Creating the User**:
   - The `useradd` command creates a new user (`$NAME`) with the home directory `/home/$NAME`. The `-p` option specifies the user's password, which is set using the encrypted version of the password obtained from `openssl`.

4. **Password Encryption**:
   - The command `$(echo "$PASS" | openssl passwd -1 -stdin)` takes the plain password from `PASS`, pipes it to `openssl passwd`, and generates an encrypted password suitable for storing in the system.

### Where is the Password Stored?
- **In the Container**:
  - The encrypted password is stored as part of the userâ€™s information in the container's user database (specifically in `/etc/shadow` for systems that use shadow passwords). The `/etc/shadow` file contains the username and the hashed (encrypted) password. This file is typically only accessible by the root user and certain privileged processes.

### Important Security Considerations:
1. **Temporary Availability**:
   - The secret (the plain text password) is only available during the build process and is not included in the final Docker image. Once the build step is complete, the secret is no longer accessible.

2. **Encrypted Storage**:
   - The password is stored in an encrypted form in the `/etc/shadow` file. When a user tries to log in, the system compares the provided password (after hashing it) to the stored hash in `/etc/shadow` for verification.

3. **Avoiding Plain Text**:
   - It's crucial not to expose the plain text password in the Dockerfile or logs. Using secrets with BuildKit ensures that sensitive data remains secure during the build process.

### Summary:
- The password is temporarily stored in memory during the build process and then encrypted and stored in the user database within the container. The plain text version is never retained in the final image, and only the encrypted password exists in the `/etc/shadow` file for authentication. This approach helps maintain security while allowing user creation in the container.
