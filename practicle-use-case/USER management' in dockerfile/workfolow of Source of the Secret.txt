The `--mount=type=secret` feature in Docker mounts data into the build process from a specified source on your host system or from a Docker build context. Here's how it works:

### Source of the Secret

1. **Secret Definition**:
   - When you build the Docker image, you specify the secret you want to use with the `--secret` option in your build command. This option defines the secret ID and the source file that contains the secret.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --secret id=mysecret,src=mysecret.txt -t myimage .
   ```
   - In this example, `src=mysecret.txt` is the path to a file on your host machine that contains the sensitive data you want to pass to the build process.

2. **Mounting the Secret**:
   - During the build, Docker mounts this secret to a specific location inside the build environment (e.g., `/run/secrets/mysecret`).
   - This means that during the execution of a `RUN` command in your Dockerfile that uses `--mount=type=secret`, you can access the secret at this path.

### Summary of the Process

- **Build Command**: You define a secret with the `--secret` flag in the `docker build` command.
- **Source File**: The secret is sourced from a file on your host system (e.g., `mysecret.txt`).
- **Mount Point**: During the build, Docker mounts the secret at a specified path inside the container's build environment (e.g., `/run/secrets/mysecret`).
- **Accessing the Secret**: Inside your Dockerfile, you can access the secret using commands that read from the mount point, such as `cat /run/secrets/mysecret`.

### Key Points

- The secret is only available during the specific build step that includes the `--mount` command.
- After the build step completes, the secret is not accessible in subsequent steps or in the final image, ensuring that sensitive information is not leaked or exposed.

This mechanism helps you securely handle sensitive information during the Docker image build process without compromising security best practices.
