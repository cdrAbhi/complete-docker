Dockerfile
===========
A Dockerfile is a document that contains a series of instructions or scripts used to create a Docker image.

Label 
=======
A LABEL instruction in a Dockerfile is used to add metadata to a Docker image, such as information about volumes, networks,
license, or other organizational details. This metadata helps in categorizing and managing Docker images.

ENV
===
The ENV instruction in a Dockerfile is used to set environment variables in an image. These environment variables are 
persisted and available when the container is run.

RUN 
===
The RUN instruction in a Dockerfile is used to execute a command in a new layer on top of the current image. The resulting 
image layer will be used as the base for the next instruction in the Dockerfile.

WORKDIR
======
The WORKDIR instruction in a Dockerfile is used to set the working directory for any subsequent instructions that follow 
it in the Dockerfile.
                                        OR
The WORKDIR instruction in a Dockerfile sets the working directory for any subsequent instructions that follow it. 
This means that all relative paths in the Dockerfile will be based on this directory, making it easier to manage 
paths within the container.

ADD,COPY
========

COPY:
=====
    => Best for straightforward copying of local files and directories.
    => Does not perform any additional operations on the files.
ADD:
=====    
    => More versatile with automatic extraction of compressed files and the ability to handle remote URLs.
    => Use ADD for tasks requiring these additional capabilities, otherwise prefer COPY for clarity and simplicity.
